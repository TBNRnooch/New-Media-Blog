	<h1>Does the Internet Limit Our Perspective?</h1>


	<p><b>Would you rather be correct, or corrected? Most people would choose to be correct. With the internet, we all have access to infinite information at our fingertips; however, the internet is not always honest with the information they give us. The longer you spend on the internet, the more money it makes. Therefore, the internet uses our confirmation bias against us. People generally gravitate to ideas that correspond to their own and reject ideas that don’t. This is known as confirmation bias, and it’s why most people prefer to be correct, as opposed to being corrected. </b></p>

</div>

<div>
	<span><p><b>The media takes advantage of conformation bias. It is very good at limiting different perspectives on a situation. A good example of this appears in "On the come up" by Angie Thomas. After a riot breaks out at Bri's school, the news uses Bri’s song as an excuse for the riot happening, instead of the underlying problem of racism. The news only played parts of Bri’s song that exclaims “she’s a thug”, choosing to omit the lines where she denies this stereotype and talks about racism in her neighborhood. Another example from this book is Bri’s interview with DJ Hype. During the interview, Hype purposefully provokes Bri, making her unable to tell the truth. Rather, the interview is done on purpose to make Bri appear more like a “ratchet hood rat”, which she isn’t.</b></p></span>

<p><b>Social media is no different, and Instagram is a prime example. Instagram is especially good at shielding people from other points of view. On Instagram, the feed is filled mostly with posts from people one follows, or posts from people posting similar things as one’s following. This only reinforces people’s own ideas, making it difficult for them to see other perspectives.</b></p>

<p><b>	I think that people should learn to be more open-minded and accepting of other ideas. Open-mindedness could be a great help in eliminating social issues such as racism, homophobia and anti-Semitism. This is explored in a Ted Talk by Daryl Davis, where he tells his story about attending KKK rallies as a black man. </b></p>

<p class="description">Daryl Davis's Ted Talk: "Why I, as a black man, attended KKK rallies."</p>
</div>

<p><b>He learnt from his journey “Ignorance breeds fear. We fear those things we do not understand. If we do not keep that fear in check, it will breed hatred. If we do not keep that hatred in check, that hatred, in turn, will breed destruction. We want to destroy those things that we hate. Why? Because they cause us to be afraid. But guess what? They may have been harmless, and we were just ignorant.” When solving a problem, we must search for the root cause. In this case, Davis teaches us that the root cause for hatred is ignorance. By showing us what we like to see, the internet is only fuelling ignorance. Why should this be? The internet is the biggest platform where everyone can share information with one another. Shouldn’t this be the exact platform used to educate people of their wrongs? Why are we reinforcing ignorance, the root cause of fear? Shouldn’t we be doing everything we can in order to eradicate it? </b></p>
